        <h3> Project Description</h3>
        <p className = "des text">The Movie Zone is a website I made in class 122B. Honestly, it is my child. I spent 3 months on this product with all my passion and tons of "hairs"
        <br /><br />I used microservice with MySql for its database. There are 4 databases work separately and independently.
        <br /><br />I implemented the back-end with Java, which is my most proficient language.
        <br /><br />The front-end I used JavaScript and jQuery!
        </p>
